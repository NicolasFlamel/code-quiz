# Code Quiz

## Description

This project was to practice and hone my JavaScript skills I have learned up to now. I used different skills such as local storage, event listeners, setting data attributes, and traversing the DOM. It's also a good way to quiz myself on the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the future I can add or change the questions with little effort and to include harder or a larger viarity of questions.
